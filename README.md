## Employee Wage Tracker CLI

- A command-line Node.js application that reads structured employee data from a text file and calculates the total hours worked and total earnings per employee. Results are sorted alphabetically and printed to the console.

## Example Input and Output

**Input (`.txt` file):**
Employee Matt
Employee Jeff
Employee Mike
Pay Matt 10
Pay Jeff 20
Pay Mike 15
Time Matt 07:15 12:45
Time Jeff 10:00 16:45
Time Matt 13:00 18:00

**Expected Output:**
Jeff: 6.75 hours 135 earned
Matt: 10.5 hours 105 earned
Mike: 0 hours 0 earned

## Features

- Add employees to a tracker (without overwriting if already exists)
- Assign hourly rates and worked time intervals
- Calculate hours using a library called `dayjs` and display results in decimal format
- Automatically creates an employee if a `Pay` command is issued for a non-existent name
- Outputs sorted results alphabetically
- Includes `.gitignore` to prevent uploading unnecessary files such as `node_modules/`, `coverage/`, `.DS_Store`, etc.

## Included test files.txt

- `EmpTestFile.txt`: Default input file used by `npm start`
- `SecondCaseFile.txt`: Contains repeated employees to test non-overwriting
- `ThirdCaseFile.txt`: Contains a `Pay` command for a non-existent employee to test auto-creation

â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ addEmployee.js # Adds a new employee if not exists
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ addRate.js # Sets Pay and Time=0 (creates if missing)
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ addTime.js # Adds worked time to employee
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ findTime.js # Calculates hour difference using Day.js
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ logOutput.js # Outputs final report sorted by name
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ EmpTestFile.txt # Default test file (used by default).
â”œâ”€â”€ SecondCaseFile.txt # Contains repeated Employee command (ignored).
â”œâ”€â”€ ThirdCaseFile.txt # Pay command for non-existent name (creates new employee).
â””â”€â”€ README.md

## Running App

- 'npm run start' is going to run EmpTestFile.txt file as default value
- 'npm run start SecondCaseFile.txt' is going to run SecondCaseFile.txt file
- 'npm run start ThirdCaseFile.txt' is going to run ThirdCaseFile.txt file
- 'npm run start [CustomFile.txt]' If the user want to create and runs his custom file

## Running Tests

- 'npm test' to run all test files
- 'npx jest test/addRate.test.js' to run a specific test file
- 'npx jest --coverage' to view test coverage

## Logic Summary

- addEmployee(name): Only adds if the employee doesnâ€™t already exist.
- addRate(name, rate): Adds Pay and initializes Time=0. If the employee doesn't exist, it's created automatically.
- addTime(name, start, end): Calculates time with dayjs() and accumulates it if already present.
- logOutput(): Outputs all employee summaries in alphabetical order.
